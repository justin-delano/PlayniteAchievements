    Changelog:
      - Epic Games support! XP is being tracked, but UI is not quite prepared for displaying it yet.

      - Steam - progress bar fallback should actually work now.
      - More language fixes and global language setting. Please report any other datetime parsing issues you encounter.
      - Per-provider disable options for scanning.
